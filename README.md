# Hello-World
This is a practice repository 
In west Philidelphia, born and raised
on the playground is where I spent most of my days
chilling out maxin', relaxin' all cool 
and all shooting some bball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my neighborhood 

I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
she said you're moving with your aunt and uncle in belle air

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
the license plate said "Fresh" it had a dice in the mirror
if anything I could say that this cab was rare, 
but I thought nah forget it, yo home to belle air

I pulled up to a house about 7 or 8 
and I yelled to the cabby yo homes smell ya later
I look at my home I was finally there,
to sit on my throne as the prince of belle air
